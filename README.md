# Machine-Learning
GymLens is a machine learning-based project designed to classify gym equipment from user-uploaded images. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and provides comprehensive usage instructions for various types of gym equipment. By leveraging TensorFlow and transfer learning, the project aims to promote fitness awareness and improve accessibility for gym beginners.
